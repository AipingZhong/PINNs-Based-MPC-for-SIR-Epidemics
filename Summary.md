\# SUMMARY

This repository contains the supplementary code for “A Physics-Informed Neural Networks‑Based Model Predictive Control Framework for SIR Epidemics”.



\## Components

\- `code/PINNs-Based MPC Frameworks/`: main implementations of MPC‑PINNs, MPC‑LS‑PINNs, MPC‑SI‑PINNs, and generalized variants.

\- `code/Supporting Material\_NN Architectures/`: scripts for architecture comparisons.

\- `code/Supporting Material\_Sensitive Analysis/`: scripts for parameter-sensitivity experiments.

\- `code/requirements`: dependency specifications.



\## Intent

Provide runnable implementations that reproduce the simulated results and illustrative figures reported in the paper/supplementary material, and serve as a starting point for applying the framework to further exploring settings.
